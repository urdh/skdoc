This is version 1.4 of the skdoc document class. It is designed to
generate both documentation and derivative files using only LaTeX,
i.e. without using docstrip and ins/dtx files.

The following files are enclosed.

  README        - This file
  Makefile      - GNU Makefile for making the package and documentation
  skdoc.dtx     - LaTeX source code of the package
  skdoc.pdf     - PDF version of the documentation

Installation notes:
The easiest way to install this package, assuming you have obtained the
source code from Github or CTAN, is to simply run `make install`. This
will generate package code and documentation, install it into TEXMFHOME
and run `mktexlsr`. If you wish to compile the package but not install
it, run `make all` instead. If you insist on doing it manually, remember
to run `tex` to generate the code, and `pdflatex` (or `latex`, if you
don't fancy PDFs) to generate the documentation.
